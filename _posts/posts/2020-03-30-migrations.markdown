As part of the Programmier Praktikum 2020 at TU-Berlin, we had two teams of students migrate the participatory environmental data platform [opensense.network](https://opensense.network) to the serverless platform OpenWhisk. 

Both teams learned a lot, find their experience reports [here](https://medium.com/@niklas.andres/serverless-apis-migration-to-openwhisk-7308a4f7a543) and [here](https://medium.com/@flamestro/challenges-of-moving-to-serverless-aae4d6e901c1). One of there crucial findings is that you still need to refactor applications a lot to utilize FaaS platforms fully. 

We hope that the SMILE project can reduce this developer overhead in the future!
