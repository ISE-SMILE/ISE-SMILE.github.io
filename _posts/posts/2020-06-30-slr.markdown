As part of the Smile-Project we are interested in migrating data intensive applications. During the first month of the project we startet to look at existing projects in that space, by performing a systematic literatur study.

Based on this we were already able to identify nine interesting frameworks. We plan to release the full study later this year, but here is a teaser of the frameworks we found so far. All show potential and follow a similar application model, that we might use in SMILE as well.
