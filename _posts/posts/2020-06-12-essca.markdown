Today, we had the pleasure to present our paper "Diminuendo! Tactics in Support of FaaS Migrations" (to be published in July) at the [Second European Symposium on Serverless Computing and Applications](https://www.agilealliance.org/xp2020/call-for-submissions/call-for-research-workshop-proposals/european-symposium-on-serverless-computing-and-applications/). 

In the paper we present five migration tactics in support of futur migration of data-intensive applications. We plan to integrate them in the SMILE project.
